Our project involves creating software platform for Universal Testing Machine. 
It involves a main software that will run on PC as well as a smaller software that'll run on Arduino. 
The software on Arduino will mainly facilate communication between hardware and the software on PC.
I've created 2 separate use case diagrams: one for PC software and one for Arduino software .
However, all other UML diagrams are for the PC software only.
