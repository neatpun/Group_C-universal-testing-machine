This is a python script for combining log files generated 
from loadstar sensor and from our UTM software.

Please see the folder "Fri Apr  6 15-12-49 2018" 
for an example of output generated by the script using the inputs
"abc.csv" (our software's log file) and 
"lv.csv" (log file generated by loadstar sensor software).
